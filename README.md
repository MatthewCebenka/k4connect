I'm assuming this application if using real data would be a news feed. 
To finish this app I would: 
  1. Make sure that each image has a standard rendering size. 
  2. Add a "Read" Button that opens an in app browser to the article
  3. Also maybe add a "save story" button so that the user can read stories later
